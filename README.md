## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I have learn to apply the BEM naming convention into this specific object `card` which demonnstrate through the design of my `body`.

```html
<div class="card">
  <div class="card__qr">
    <img class="card__qr-icon" src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code" />
  </div>
  <div class="card__body">
    <h1 class="card__body-title">...</h1>
    <p class="card__body-paragraph">...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Additionally, I start to understand the fundamental of center the `card` in the middle of the screen via calculate the gap by `viewport height` and `auto` margin for the `left` and `right` using the `margin`.

```css
.card {
  background-color: var(--white);
  width: 320px;
  height: 497px;
  margin: calc((100vh - 497px) / 2) auto;
  border-radius: 20px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

In the near future I will try to work on ultilize the variable such as predefine the width and height of the card to optimize the repitation in `css` code.
